## Background
The melodrama of the CCP handling COVID-19 started in 2020, by the time I was 16, in Senior I high school (under the Chinese education system). Thanks to the melodrama, I became an expert in slacking in class - not gaming, but writing my homework during classes and building up my hobbies, like self-teaching Python.

I started this project in April 2020 and finished in June. Why took me so long? Because I have other things to slack lol, also because my English skills were a piece of stool at that time - pretty much like my French skills right now (April 2024). I had no idea about anything because, before that, my coding skills were limited to Linux bash, cmd and Scratch. Translating apps was quite a piece of stool (stop using that word Eden) as well, so I had to work on tutorials in StackOverFlow with both language barriers and coding barriers.

Thinking of that, I'm quite proud of myself. **That seems to be the start of everything - really everything - like the root node of a set** - I would be in a normal university in China learning Marx's theory and worshipping CCP if I didn't make that step - by changing my enthusiasm for Computer Science into a realistic one. I somehow learnt sets, write GUI programs and how to compile a `.py` program into `.exe`, the same things that I did in early 2024 - ANDIE and data structures.

Surprisingly, after a year, in 2021, my program got popular in my class - everyone knows this program. I put all the memes of my classmates I collected in this program and made a gallery for that (as you can see). Some people admire me, some people hate me because their memes are too "vivid". My Chinese teacher Ms Cui somehow knew about this program, and she helped me to make this program even more popular - in the whole grade - she copied the release (which I have lost), distributed it to all the Chinese teachers and they have installed this program on all the class computers in the Senior II building (which I believe they're still there).

It was so popular yet unfortunately, few people know that I coded this program - they think it was made by the IT teacher Mr Yang Chen! On the other hand, when I mention "I am the author of LuckyGod" to someone in my high school who doesn't know me, they would be surprised and remember me, which has brought me some close friends.

I also did 1.5 years of demonstrating in high school - Mr Yang Chen and Ms Qiujing Yang would give me 5 - 10 minutes to share some interesting knowledge related to IT. With this opportunity, I explained the source code of this program to my classmates.

So here we go, I'll take you to the me(as a program) of that time.
