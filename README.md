## **WELCOME TO THE FIRST PROJECT THE GREATEST EDEN HAS EVER MADE IN HIS LIFE**

**Still not working on my new computer.............**â€˜

##Background
COVID-19 started in 2020, by the time I was 16, in Senior 1 (under Chinese educating system). Thanks to the silly Chinese goverment, I became an expert in slacking - not gaming. but writing my homework during classes, and also building up my hobbys, like self-teaching python.
I started this project in April 2020 and finished in June. Why took me so long? Cuz I got other things to slack, also cuz my English skill was a piece of stool at that time - pretty much as my French skill right now (April 2024). I had no idea about anyting cuz, before that, my coding skills were only limited in Linux bash, cmd and Scratch. Translating apps were quite a piece of stool (stop using this word Eden) as well, so I had to work on tutorials with both language barriers and coding barriers. Thinking of that, I'm quite proud of myself. That seems to be the startpoint of everything - really everything - like a root set - I would be in a normal university in China learning Marx's theory and worship CCP if I didn't make that step - by changing my enthusiastic in Computer Science into realistic.
I somehow learnt sets, arrays, and how to write GUI programs, same things that I'm doing right now - ANDIE and data structures.
