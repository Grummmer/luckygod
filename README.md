## Background
The melodrama of the CCP handling COVID-19 started in 2020, by the time I was 16, in Senior 1 high school (under the Chinese education system). Thanks to the melodrama, I became an expert in slacking in class - not gaming, but writing my homework during classes, and also building up my hobbies, like self-teaching Python.

I started this project in April 2020 and finished in June. Why took me so long? Cuz I have other things to slack lol, also cuz my English skills were a piece of stool at that time - pretty much like my French skills right now (April 2024). I had no idea about anything cuz, before that, my coding skills were only limited to Linux bash, cmd and Scratch. Translating apps was quite a piece of stool (stop using that word Eden) as well, so I had to work on tutorials in StackOverFlow with both language barriers and coding barriers.

Thinking of that, I'm quite proud of myself. **That seems to be the start of everything - really everything - like the root node of a set** - I would be in a normal university in China learning Marx's theory and worshipping CCP if I didn't make that step - by changing my enthusiasm for Computer Science into a realistic one. I somehow learnt sets, write GUI programs and how to compile a .py program into .exe, the same things that I'm doing right now - ANDIE and data structures.

So here you go, I'll take you to the me of that time.
